Spring also offers the MVC framework for developing web applications

Spring framework
    Spring boot and MVC are both components of the spring framework.
    Spring offers dependency injection and IoC, which is good for working with other frameworks
    it defines beans using different annotations and autowires them
    helps build loosely coupled applications that are easy to unit test. It also eliminates plumbing code, exception handling etc.

Spring MVC
    is an HTTP oriented spring framework, which is concerned with developing web applications
    it uses the Model-View-Controller MVC design pattern to have separation of concerns
(Model, service/repositories)------>(Provides data/results)-------->(View)

   |                                                                   |
   |                                                                   |
(Controller)<----------<------(request)-------<---------<--------(person sees)

    The DispatcherServlet is the front controller that handles all requests while the View Resolver
    is resolving view names to physical views. this decoupling makes dev. of web apps and RESTful services simple
    because the model, view, and controller operate without dependency
    when previously built a web service with spring boot, it internally made use of Spring MVC.
    which helped create a web app that is scalable and testable

Spring Boot
    is designed to solve configuration issues, by autoconfiguring many dependencies based on the type of app
    offers pre-configured projects to bootstrap an app in few steps
    the DispatcherServlet, View Resolver, Data Source, Transaction Manager, etc. get configured automatically.
    Spring Boot configures compatible versions of the dependencies needed. as well as monitoring features.
    helps kickstart the project by bringing in all the dependencies.
    however spring boot offers a biased view and has strong preferences about the dependencies it uses
