so far created a Get controller to output a list of movies in JSON format on http request
but if a change is made to the controller a server restart is required to go into effect
leading to the Devtools dependency

Spring Boot has a Developer Tool that supports live reloads
add below to the pom.xml file
    <dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    if the scope of this dependency is limited to runtime using the tag
    <scope>runtime</scope> it will not be packaged in the jar

    had to ensure advanced settings under compiler allow auto-make is enabled
    and file, setting, build, execution, deployment, compiler is set build proj. automatically
    after a project restart any update to the code will change live

    must run in the terminal not with intelliJ run button command is
    mvn spring-boot:run
