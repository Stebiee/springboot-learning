JdbcTemplate
    is a class which contains methods like
    .execute()
    which can be used to create a table
    this is DDL or Data Definition Language

Create a table Query
    for example creating a Tournament table to store details of a tennis tournament
    rows would be id, name, location

    public void createTournamentTable() {
        String sql = "CREATE TABLE TOURNAMENT (ID INTEGER, NAME VARCHAR(50)," +
                "LOCATION VARCHAR(50), PRIMARY KEY (ID))";

        jdbcTemplate.execute(sql);
        System.out.println("Table created successfully");
    }

    then calling the method in the run() from implementing CommandLineRunner to the app
    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        dao.createTournamentTable();
    }

    this can be viewed from the h2 console
