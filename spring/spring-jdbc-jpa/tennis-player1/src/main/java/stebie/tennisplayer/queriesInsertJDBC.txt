learning to write to a db using methods of the JdbcTemplate class

to insert a row we need to send a Player object as inpur parameter

JdbcTemplate.update(sql, new Object[] {params})
    is used for an INSERT query

    it takes a sql query as well as an array of objects containing the values that will be inserted.
    returns int val which shows the number of rows affected by this query

    will be executed with the run method from implementing the interface CommandLineRunner to the app

public int insertPlayer(Player player) {
        String sql = "INSERT INTO PLAYER (ID, Name, Nationality,Birth_date, Titles) " +
                "VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";

        return jdbcTemplate.update(sql, new Object[]
                { player.getId(), player.getName(), player.getNationality(),
                player.getBirthDate(), player.getTitles()});
}
