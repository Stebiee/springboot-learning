leaning how to update an existing record in a database

JdbcTemplate.update(sql, new Object[]{params})
    is used to execute INSERT as well as UPDATE queries.
    to update a record in the table create a method
    updatePlayer() which is similar to insertPlayer() only diff. is in the query
    changing INSERT to UPDATE

    the updatePlayer takes a Player object and update the row corresponding to the id
    recap: update from JdbcTemplate returns an int for the number of rows affected

execution of UPDATE query
    to execute in the run method from implementing CommandLineRunner
    initialize a Player object with the values we want to update and pass it to the jdbcTemplate.updatePlayer()
    recap: updatePlayer() will return an in representing amount of rows affected

method in dao
public int updatePlayer(Player player) {
    String sql = "UPDATE PLAYER SET Name = ?, Nationality = ?, " +
                "Birth_date = ?, Titles = ? WHERE ID = ?";

    return jdbcTemplate.update(sql, new Object[]{
                                    player.getName(),
                                    player.getNationality(),
                                    new Timestamp(player.getBirthDate().getTime()),
                                    player.getTitles(),
                                    player.getId()} );
}

execution in run method from implementing CommandLineRunner in app
logger.info("Updating Player 4: {}", dao.updatePlayer(new Player(
							4, "Roger Federer", "Swiss",
							Date.valueOf("2000-02-27"), 104)));
