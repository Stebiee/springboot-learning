Configuring db connection
    the in memory db H2 has automatically been configured. the url can be found from console log
    this value is randomly generated each server restart
    to make the url a constant configure in application.properties
*   spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:mem:testdb

    the next task is connecting to the h2 db
    Spring Boot autoconfigures the H2 dependency and a connection to the db
    the H2 console can be enabled in application.properties
*   spring.h2.console.enabled = true

    db can be viewed at localhost:8080/h2-console
    on the login page make sure the JDBC URL is the same as defined in application.properties
    generic h2 embedded for setting
    driver class is org.h2.Driver
    url: what is set in application properties usually jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    username: sa
    password: usually blank

creating a table
    since the db is in memory, the table will be lost after the server restarts
    so best to create things like tables within a sql file
    this is created in src/main/resources/schema.sql
    this file is called every app launch, and contains all DDL (data definition language) queries
    this proj creates a table called Player with 5 columns

view a table
    SELECT * FROM table;

inserting data.
    data can be inserted from the h2 console. but since it resets best from file
    another SQL file is created in src/main/resources/data.sql
    which contains the DML (data manipulation language) queries, like insert
