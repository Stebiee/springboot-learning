creating an entity and look at the diff. annotations

JPA dependency
    to use Spring JPA add the starter JPA dependency to the pom.xml
    <dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    this API defines many annotations like
        @Entity
        @Column
        @Table
    Hibernate is an implementation of the JPA API which automatically gets configured in the app
    the hibernate-core should be in the Maven Dependencies folder

@Entity
    the Player class lists attributes ofa tennis player
    JPA needs to be told the objects of this class need to be mapped to a table in a db
    JPA will create a table with the same name as the class and columns for all the members of the class
    every instance of the Player class will become a row in the table
*   make no-arg, arg-without id, and all-arg constructors
*   as well as getters and setters for fields and toString

@Table(name="otherName")
    if the class should be mapped to a table with a different name this annotation is used
    provide the name for the table to which the bean maps to

@Id and @GeneratedValue
    every table in a relational database has a primary key.
    the Id attribute uniquely identifies each object
    @Id is used to indicate the primary key
    JPA can also generate the primary key when rows are inserted
    @GeneratedValue will automatically generate Id values

    now whenever a new row is inserted Id does not need to be given.


@Column(name="columnName")
    is used to define the column mappings
    it mentions the name of the column that matches an attribute in the class
    example:
        @Column(name="player_name")
        private String name;

    this annotation wouldn't be needed if the column name and attribute are identical

JPA schema creation
    Spring Boot autoconfiguration triggers a schema update and creates a table by the same name
    as the class marked with @Entity
    with JPA the table does not need to be created schema.sql is commented out
