learning to write a named query in JPQL, java persistence query language
    a named query is defined on an entity, the Player class
    the named query will be used in the getAllPlayers() method

@NamedQuery(name="", query="")
    to create a named query, use the @NamedQuery annotation on object
    the annotation has two attributes, name and query

    when using JPA, will write queries in JPQL instead of SQL
    jpql uses entities in place of tables since we want to return a list of Player objects
    query will be "SELECT p FROM Player p"

    @Entity
    @NamedQuery(name = "get_all_players", query = "select p from Player p")
    public class Player

    this named query will be used in the getAllPlayers() method

    getAllPlayers() method will use the createNamedQuery() method from entityManager
    pass the name of the query and specify what the query will return
    prev. defined name of the query as get_all_players() which returns objects of Player class
    the createNamedQuery() method will return a TypedQuery, which will assign to a variable called getAll
    then getAll.getResultList() is used to return a list of players

    public List<Player> getAllPlayers() {
        TypedQuery<Player> getAll = entityManager.createNamedQuery("get_all_players", Player.class);

        return getAll.getResultList();
    }
