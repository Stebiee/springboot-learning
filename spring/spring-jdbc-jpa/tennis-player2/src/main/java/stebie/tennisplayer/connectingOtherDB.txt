learn about the changes required to change the data source
covering replacement of the H2 dependency
configuring the property values

an in-memory H2 db is easy to set up and use. time to learn how to switch to another db
some examples would be switching to Oracle, MySql, or SQL server databases
Spring Boot makes this process straight forward
add some dependencies and change some property values
assuming the database is installed and the schema is properly populated

Replacing the H2 dependency
    remove the H2 dependency from the pom.xml file
    replace it with the dependency of the db chosen
    if wanting to connect the MySql dependency is
    <dependency>
      <groupId>mysql</groupId>
      <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    </dependency>

Config property values
    for any db, URL, username, and password need to be configured in application.properties

    since schema is already created, and do not want Hibernate to create it set it to none
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
        other options would be, create-only, drop, create, validate, update
        create, Hibernate would look at the entities and create the schema itself (drops the previous schema)

    spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/movie_example
    spring.datasource.username = demo
    spring.datasource.password = demo

    After making these changes, restart the app and Spring Boot will connect to the database
