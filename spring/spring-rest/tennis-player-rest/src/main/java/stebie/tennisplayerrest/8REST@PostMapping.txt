learn how to add a record to the db using POST request
covering, save(), @PostMapping, @RequestBody, creating POST request

will create an endpoint for the REST API which creates a new player and adds it to the db

REST client will send a POST request to /players
    body of the request contains the JSON data for a player
    since this would be a new player, client won't pass the primary key
    backend system will generate the key for the new record and return it to the client

REST service will convert JSON data to POJO and add it to the db
primary key of the added player is automatically generated by Hibernate, the default ORM used by Spring Data JPA
the response to the client is an echo of the player details along with the new ID value


addPlayer()
    begin by writing the Service layer method to add a player
        remember, REST client sends a Player without id, and db echos the Player with id added
    takes a Player object
    returns the entity that has been added


    save()
        JpaRepository interface inherits a method from the CrudRepository called save()
        this method handles both inserts and updates. to distinguish  between an INSERT and UPDATE operation
        the method checks the primary key of the passed object to it
            if the primary key is null or empty, INSERT
            otherwise UPDATE

    method will ensure that the primary key, Id,in the Player object is empty so that the record is inserted

@PostMapping("")
addPlayer(@RequestBody Object obj)
    after writing the service layer method for adding a player, move to the control layer

    this method will have a mapping for a POST request to /players
    method will return the inserted record back to the client

    @PostMapping maps HTTP POST requests to controller methods
        is a shortcut annotation for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)

    @RequestBody  client will send the player data in the request body as JSON
        Jackson will cover the conversion to POJO
        and the annotation handles this conversion
        and binds the data in the request body to a method parameter

    now inside the method
    primary key is set to zero
        done to ensure that if the client passes an id, it is removed before being sent to the service layer
        save() offered by the JpaRepository works for INSERT, UPDATE by checking the primary key
        and then chooses based on its value

    now send the request to add the player to the service layer


Creating POST request
    can now test the new endpoint with postman
    sending data is done with a post request
    when sending json data to a rest controller, set a http request header
        information in the header tells the controller how to process the data
    setting up the request Body is chosen and raw item is chosen since raw json will be tested
