create a controller to map requests to our REST API
covering @RestController, adding request mapping, testing the RESTful endpoint

will create a REST service with a request mapping /welcome and send it a request
from a REST client (web browser or Postman), the service then responds with a welcome message

@RestController
   create PlayerController class with the annotation @RestController
        is extension of the @Controller,
        has support for REST requests and responses
        automatically handles the data binding between java POJOS and JSON

   Adding request mapping
        next, set up a mapping for the request using the @GetMapping annotation

        @GetMapping("/welcome")
        public String welcome() {
            return "Tennis Player REST API";
        }
        this code creates a RESTful endpoint /test-api which can be accessed from the REST client
        and returns the message to the client
        @GetMapping is discussed later

   Testing the RESTful endpoint
        will test the REST endpoint with a web browser as well as Postman.
        and access the results at localhost:8080/test-api through Postman or browser
