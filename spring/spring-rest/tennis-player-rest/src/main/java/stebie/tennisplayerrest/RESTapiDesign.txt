basic principles for REST API and create one with Spring Initializer

will build a REST API that performs CRUD operations make use of previous tennis player project
to create a RESET API to perform CRUD operations on the data stored in the in-memory H2 db

REST API design 
    this REST API will expose endpoints which allow a REST client to perform the following functions
        get a list of players
        get a player by id
        add a new player
        update an existing player
        update the titles of a player
        delete a player
    
    will make use of the HTTP GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE methods to perform these operations
    to create service endpoints for our REST API, we need to identify the entity (main resource)
    which is the most notable noun from the requirements listed. the requirements show that is is player

    a REST API design convention is to use the plural of the entity as the endpoint, so we will use /players

    following table shows the HTTP methods and their REST endpoints for the corresponding CRUD operations
    Operation               HTTP Method          URL
    Create a player         POST                 /players
    Show all players        GET                  /players
    Show player by ID       GET                  /players/{id}
    Update a player         PUT                  /players/{id}
    Partial update player   PATCH                /players/{id}
    Delete a player         DELETE               /players/{id}

    no action words like show or create are in the endpoints 
    rather the HTTP method, like GET and POST defines the action to be performed
