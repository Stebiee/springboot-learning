what is springboot?
    spring boot enables robust creation of apps
    it provides features like servers, but by itself not an application or server

    autoconfiguration is a feature of spring boot where it provides all the dependencies to start a project
    for example starter web automatically configures everything needed for a web application

    similarly starter JPA configures basic JPA along with Hibernate
    spring boot makes the creation of a wep app easier
    it takes the responsibility of making frameworks compatible with each other
    you just need to specify the uber dependency like starter web, and spring boot will configure the
    compatible versions of spring-core, dispatcher servlet, view resolver, logging, security, and validation
    frameworks along with exception handling and support for internationalization.
    saving time spent on the initial creation of a project

starter projects
    have a set of pre-configured dependencies to simplify the build configuration

    Start web is the preferred starter for web apps including RESTful applications using spring MVC
        it uses tomcat as the default embedded container.
        the pom.xml file of spring-boot-starter-web shows dependencies like spring-web/webmvc, starter-tomcat/json
        for conversion to JSON when a web service is invoked.

    Starter test is the dependency for testing spring boot apps with libraries like
        JUnit Jupiter, Hamcrest, and Mockito
        spring-boot-starter-test enables the dev to write unit and integration tests.
        the pom.xml shows dependencies on JUnit, AssertJ, and Mockito
        it has Hamcrest that, in combination with AssertJ, is used for writing matchers

    Starter JPA is another starter project
        JPA is the interface for the Hibernate framework
        starter-data-jpa is used for Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
        pom.xml shows dependency on spring-boot-starter-aop, spring-boot-starter-jdbc, hibernate-core, and transaction-api
