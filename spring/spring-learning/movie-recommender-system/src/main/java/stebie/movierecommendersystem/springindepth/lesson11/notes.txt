managing bean init and life cycle
also got into using a logger instead of sout to the console
import org.slf4j.Logger;
@PostConstruct to set a method which executes after dependencies are all loaded
    loading data, setting up connections
@PreDestroy to set a method which executes right before the bean is destroyed
    releasing resources, closing connections
